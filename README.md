An easy way to interact with structs and enums wrapped in [`Cow`][cow].

## Concept

The standard library has a [clone on write type][cow], which allows to work
with either owned or borrowed data, without any distinction. However, this can
lead to a lot of code duplication in some situations.

[cow]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/borrow/enum.Cow.html

This crate currently provide the following functionalities:
  - destucturing any struct wrapped in `Cow`,
  - pattern matching on structs and enum in `Cow`,
  - iteration over collections wrapped in `Cow`,
  - `Cow` flattening,
  - `Cow` unnesting.

### Destructuring

The `Butcher` trait can be derived on structs and enums. Destructuring is then
made easy:

```rust
use std::borrow::Cow;
use butcher::Butcher;

#[derive(Butcher, Clone)]
struct MyNumberList {
    val: u32,
    next: Option<Box<MyNumberList>>,
}

fn get_elem(i: Cow<MyNumberList>) -> Cow<u32> {
    let ButcheredMyNumberList { val, .. } = Butcher::butcher(i);

    val
}
```

### Pattern matching

The `Butcher` trait can also be derived on enums. This allows, for example:

```rust
use butcher::Butcher;
use std::borrow::Cow;

#[derive(Butcher, Clone)]
enum WebEvent {
    PageLoad,
    KeyPress(char),
    Paste(String),
    // or c-like structures.
    Click { x: i64, y: i64 },
}

fn print_action(i: Cow<WebEvent>) {
    match WebEvent::butcher(i) {
        ButcheredWebEvent::PageLoad => { /* ... */ },
        ButcheredWebEvent::KeyPress(key) => { /* ... */ },
        ButcheredWebEvent::Paste(pasted) => { /* ... */ },
        ButcheredWebEvent::Click { x, y } => { /* ... */ },
    }
}
```

The fields in each variant will be `Cow<T>` by default. This can be configured.
See the documentation for more information.


### Iteration

This crate provide a `CowIter` type, which allows to write `Cow` fiendly
iterators. See this example:

```rust
use std::borrow::Cow;
use butcher::iterator::CowIter;

fn print_numbers(elems: Cow<[u32]>) {
    let mut iter = CowIter::from(elems);

    for element in iter {
        // The type of element is Cow<u32>
        println!("{:?}", element);
    }
}
```

### Flattening

Thanks to the [`Deref`] trait, it is possible to `flatten` a `Cow<T>` to
`Cow<<T as Deref>::Target>`. For instance, it is possible to create a `Cow<str>`
from a `Cow<String>`, a `Cow<[T]>` from a `Cow<Vec<T>>`, and so on.

Thanks to how [`Deref`] is defined, the target type is always infered by the
type inference system, which is *very* convenient.

```rust
use std::borrow::Cow;
use butcher::flatten::FlattenCow;

let some_cow: Cow<String> = Cow::Owned(String::from("Hello ðŸ¦€"));
let flattened_cow: Cow<str> = some_cow.flatten();
```

### Unnesting

The `Unnest` trait allows to simply remove nested usage of cow. It provides the
`unnest` method, which transforms a `Cow<Cow<T>>` into `Cow<T>`.

```rust
use std::borrow::Cow;
use butcher::unnest::UnnestCow;

let foo: Cow<Cow<usize>> = Cow::Owned(Cow::Owned(42usize));
let foo_unnested: Cow<usize> = foo.unnest();
```

### Minimum Supported Rust Version

This crate compiles in rust 1.42 and older. Upgrading MSRV is a breaking change.
CI is set up so that it guarantees that the crate compiles and tests pass on
both 1.42 and stable rust.
