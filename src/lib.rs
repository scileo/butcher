//! # Butcher
//!
//! An easy way to interact with `Cow`ed structs and enums.
//!
//! This crate proposes some simple solutions to the most common patterns I met
//! while working with `Cow`s in Rust. It currently fixes the iteration pattern.
//! Other patterns will be added in a near future.
//!
//! ## Iteration
//!
//! Here is a demonstration of how to iterate over an object wrapped in a `Cow`:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::borrow::Cow;
//! use butcher::iterator::CowIter;
//!
//! fn print_numbers(elems: Cow<[u32]>) {
//!     let mut iter = CowIter::from_cow(elems);
//!
//!     for element in iter {
//!         // The type of element is Cow<u32>
//!         println!("{:?}", element);
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! See the documentation of [`CowIter`] for more information.
